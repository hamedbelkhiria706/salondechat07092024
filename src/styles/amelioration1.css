  File: amelioration1.css
  Purpose: Provides specific styling improvements or overrides.
  Note: This file defines global styles for <p> and <li> elements.
        Be mindful of CSS specificity and import order, as these styles,
        especially `p { color: white; }`, can conflict with other stylesheets
        (e.g., amelioration.css, style.css) if not managed carefully.
        These styles are best suited for contexts with dark backgrounds.

/* Paragraph Styling */
p {
  color: white; /* Default text color for paragraphs */
  /*
    WARNING: This rule makes paragraph text white globally.
    Ensure this is intended and that paragraphs styled by this rule
    appear on a sufficiently dark background for readability.
    This conflicts with `p { color: #333333; }` in `amelioration.css`
    and other general text color definitions in files like `style.css`.
    The rule that applies will depend on the CSS loading order.
  */
  line-height: 1.6; /* Improved line spacing for readability */
  margin-bottom: 1em; /* Space below paragraphs (e.g., 16px if base font is 16px) */
}

/* List Styling */
ul,
ol {
  /* Default browser user agent stylesheets usually add padding-left (e.g., 40px).
     You can adjust this as needed. Using a relative unit like '1.5em' is often good. */
  padding-left: 1.5em; /* Indentation for list markers (bullets/numbers) */
  margin-bottom: 1em; /* Space below the entire list */
}

li {
  color: antiquewhite; /* Default text color for list items */
  line-height: 1.5; /* Improved line spacing for list items */
  margin-bottom: 0.5em; /* Space below each list item */
}

/* Link Styling */
/*
  Assuming content styled by this file (with white/antiquewhite text)
  is on a dark background, links should also be light-colored.
*/
a {
  color: #87CEFA; /* LightSkyBlue - a light, distinct color for links */
  text-decoration: underline;
}

a:hover,
a:focus {
  color: #ADD8E6; /* LightBlue - slightly different shade on hover/focus */
  text-decoration: none; /* Common practice to remove underline on hover */
}

/* Example of a utility class that might fit "amelioration" */
.text-highlight {
  background-color: rgba(255, 255, 0, 0.3); /* Semi-transparent yellow highlight */
  padding: 0.1em 0.3em;
  border-radius: 3px;
}

/*
  Further considerations:
  - If these styles are meant for a specific component or section,
    consider prefixing selectors with a class (e.g., .custom-content p, .custom-content li).
  - Review for redundancies or conflicts with global.css, style.css, and amelioration.css
    to ensure a cohesive and maintainable styling strategy.
